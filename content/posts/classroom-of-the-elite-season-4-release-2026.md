The hype for Classroom of the Elite Season 4 is absolutely real, and honestly, I get it. After that wild Season 3 finale, fans have been counting down the days until we get back to Advanced Nurturing High School. The good news? We finally have a release window, and it's coming sooner than you might think.

Season 4 is diving into Year 2 of the light novels, which is a big deal for long-time fans. We're talking new first-year students, higher stakes exams, and Ayanokoji continuing his chess master moves while everyone else plays checkers. The shift to Year 2 brings fresh dynamics and challenges that even manga readers have been dying to see animated.

## Classroom of the Elite Season 4 Release Date: April 2026

According to [LiveChart](https://www.livechart.me/anime), Classroom of the Elite Season 4 is scheduled for April 2026. That puts it squarely in the Spring 2026 anime season, which is already looking stacked with heavy hitters.

April 2026 means we're looking at a premiere sometime in the first week of the month, likely around April 3-5, 2026 based on typical anime broadcast schedules. Japanese networks usually kick off their new seasons on Fridays or Saturdays, so mark your calendars for early April.

The timing makes sense too. Season 3 wrapped in late 2023, giving the production committee plenty of time to adapt the next arc properly. After the breakneck pacing of Season 2 (which crammed a ton of content into 13 episodes), hopefully this means Season 4 gets the breathing room it needs to do Year 2 justice.

## What to Expect: Year 2 First Semester Setup

Without dropping spoilers, here's what Year 2 brings to the table: new students, new power dynamics, and exams that make the previous ones look like pop quizzes.

The first semester of Year 2 introduces a fresh batch of first-year students to Advanced Nurturing High School. These aren't just background characters either. Some of these new faces shake things up for our established cast in ways that change the game completely.

Ayanokoji and Class D (well, technically they're not Class D anymore after Season 3's events) face escalating challenges as they climb the school hierarchy. The special exams get more brutal, the class point battles intensify, and everyone's strategies get way more cutthroat.

What makes Year 2 exciting is how it expands the scope beyond just the class competition. Relationships get more complex, alliances shift, and Ayanokoji's past continues to creep into the present in some pretty interesting ways.

If you missed Season 3 or need a refresher, it might be worth rewatching those final episodes. The setup from the finale directly leads into Year 2's opening moves.

## Where to Watch Classroom of the Elite Season 4

As of right now, no official streaming platform has been announced for Classroom of the Elite Season 4. However, based on previous seasons, here's what's most likely:

**Crunchyroll** is the safe bet. They've streamed Seasons 1-3, so unless something wild happens with licensing, expect Season 4 to land there for international viewers.

**Kadokawa** (the production committee) typically makes their shows available on multiple platforms, so we might also see it on:
- HIDIVE (they've been grabbing more Kadokawa titles lately)
- Netflix (though probably not until after the season finishes airing)

The official [Classroom of the Elite anime website](https://you-zitsu.com/) and Twitter account (@youkosozitsu_PR) will announce streaming details closer to the premiere date. I'd recommend following those if you want the news as soon as it drops.

## How to Prep for Season 4

If you're jumping into Season 4 fresh or just need a memory refresh, here's my recommended prep:

**Rewatch Season 3, especially episodes 11-13.** The finale sets up major threads for Year 2, including class standings, character relationships, and some big reveals about Ayanokoji's intentions.

**Key themes to remember:**
- The class point rankings and how they shifted by the end of Season 3
- Ayanokoji's evolving relationship with Kei
- The tensions between Horikita and Kushida
- Ryuuen's new role after his confrontation with Ayanokoji

**For light novel readers:** Season 4 will likely adapt volumes 4-6 of Year 2 (the overall series volumes 14-16). The anime has been pretty faithful to the source material, though with some pacing compression.

If you want to dive deeper into the source material while you wait, you can grab the Classroom of the Elite light novels on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/PRODUCTID?tag=icraveanime-20) or search [eBay for Classroom of the Elite light novels](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=classroom+of+the+elite+light+novel&mkcid=1&campid=5339142051&toolid=10001) to find good deals on physical copies.
