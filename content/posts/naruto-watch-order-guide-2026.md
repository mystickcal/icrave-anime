720 episodes. Eleven movies. An entire generation of filler arcs that traumatized weekly viewers. And somewhere inside all of that is one of the greatest coming-of-age stories anime has ever produced.

The first time I tried to binge Naruto, I hit episode 136 of the original series and realized I'd been watching filler for thirty straight episodes without knowing it. Nobody told me. The show just... kept going, and the main plot vanished. That's when I understood why "Naruto filler list" is one of the most searched anime phrases on the internet.

Here's what most watch guides get wrong: they hand you a massive spreadsheet of episode numbers and call it a day. That's not a guide. That's homework. What you actually need is a plan that matches how much time you want to invest and keeps you moving forward without burning out.

So I built three routes. Pick the one that fits your life, and let's go.

## Quick Answer: The 3 Best Naruto Watch Routes

**Route A (Minimal Canon):** Skip all filler, watch only the story Kishimoto wrote. Around 350-360 episodes total across both series. This is the fastest path from "kid with a fox demon" to "literal god of shinobi."

**Route B (Canon + Best Filler):** The canon episodes plus the handful of filler arcs that actually develop side characters and feel like they belong. Around 400-420 episodes total. My personal recommendation.

**Route C (Completionist):** Everything. All 720 episodes, all 11 movies. You're in no rush. You want to live in this world for a while. I respect it.

All three routes follow the same linear path. There's no branching timeline confusion here like with [Fate](/posts/fate-watch-order-guide-2026/). Naruto is straightforward: the only real decision is what to skip.

## Before You Start: Naruto vs Shippuden vs Boruto

If you're staring at multiple series on Crunchyroll wondering where to begin, here's the breakdown:

**Naruto** (2002-2007, 220 episodes) covers Part I of Kishimoto's manga. Naruto is 12-13 years old. The tone starts light (academy hijinks, early missions) and gradually gets darker. The Chunin Exams arc and the Sasuke Retrieval arc are where most people fall in love with the series. Fair warning: episodes 136-219 are almost entirely filler.

**Naruto: Shippuden** (2007-2017, 500 episodes) covers Part II. Naruto is 15-17. The stakes escalate fast. Political intrigue, organizations pulling strings behind the scenes, the history of the ninja world unfolding layer by layer. The animation quality jumps. The emotional beats hit harder. But the filler problem is worse here because it's scattered throughout instead of bunched at the end.

**Boruto: Naruto Next Generations** (2017-2023, 293 episodes) follows Naruto's son. Different vibe entirely. I'll cover whether you should watch it later, but the short answer is: finish Shippuden first, then decide.

One thing about pacing. Naruto is a weekly shonen from the 2000s. It was designed to fill a TV slot every seven days, which means flashbacks, recaps, and drawn-out sequences are baked into the format. Watching it weekly for fifteen years is a completely different experience than binging it in 2026. The binge actually works in the show's favor because you can skip recap openings and push through slower stretches that originally spanned months of real time.

Dub or sub? Both are fully available and both are solid. The English dub cast (Maile Flanagan as Naruto, Yuri Lowenthal as Sasuke) grew into these roles over years and delivered some genuinely great performances. If you're committing to 700+ episodes, pick whichever you'll actually stick with. Consistency matters more than purity when the finish line is that far away.

## Naruto (Original Series) Watch Order + Filler Strategy

The original series is 220 episodes. Here's how to approach it by route:

### Route A (Canon Only)

Watch episodes **1-25, 27-96, 98-100, 107-135, 141, 220.**

That's it. You get every major story beat: the bell test, Land of Waves, Chunin Exams, the Invasion, Tsunade Search, and the Sasuke Retrieval arc that ends Part I. Episode 220 is the send-off episode before Shippuden.

Skip episodes 26, 97, 101-106, and 136-219. Episodes 136-219 are the infamous "filler hell" that ran for over a year and a half during the original broadcast. The main story is done by episode 135. These filler arcs have zero impact on anything that happens in Shippuden.

### Route B (Canon + Best Filler)

Watch everything in Route A, plus:

- **Episodes 101-106** (Land of Tea arc): Light and fun. Decent character moments for the side cast. Won't change your life but won't waste your time either.
- **Episode 220**: Already in Route A, but worth highlighting. It's a proper farewell to Part I.

Still skip 136-219. Even in the "best filler" route, that stretch isn't worth it. Those 84 episodes were written to kill time while the manga got ahead, and they feel like it.

### Route C (Completionist)

Watch episodes 1-220 in order. All of it. If you're enjoying the world and don't mind slower arcs, the filler does flesh out secondary characters like Hinata, Shino, and Kiba. Some of it is genuinely fun (the curry of life episode is a meme for a reason). But go in knowing that the quality drops significantly after episode 135, and the main plot won't advance until Shippuden.

### Arc Checkpoints (Original Series)

Treat each major arc like a "season" you can complete and take a breather:

1. **Episodes 1-19** (Introduction + Land of Waves) - Your test drive. If you aren't hooked by episode 19, the show might not be for you.
2. **Episodes 20-67** (Chunin Exams) - Where Naruto transforms from "annoying kid" into a real story. Rock Lee's fight alone justifies the entire series.
3. **Episodes 68-80** (Invasion of Konoha) - The first time the stakes feel truly life-or-death.
4. **Episodes 81-100** (Search for Tsunade) - Slower, but introduces one of the best characters in the franchise.
5. **Episodes 107-135** (Sasuke Retrieval) - The emotional climax of Part I. Episode 133-134 is one of the best fights in all of anime. No exaggeration.

After each checkpoint, you have full permission to take a break. Watch something lighter. Come back when you're ready. A 720-episode series doesn't have to be a sprint.

## Naruto: Shippuden Watch Order + The Pacing Problem

Shippuden is 500 episodes, and the filler is scattered throughout the series instead of packed at the end. This is both better (you never hit an 84-episode wall) and worse (you have to actively manage what you're watching).

### Route A (Canon Only)

**Canon episodes to watch:**

Episodes 1-56, 72-90, 113-143, 152-169, 172-175, 197-222, 243-256, 261-270, 272-278, 282-283, 296-302, 321-346, 362-375, 378-387, 391-393, 414-415, 418-421, 424-426, 451-463, 469-479, 484-500.

I know that looks like a wall of numbers. Here's the practical version: use a filler list (animefillerlist.com is the gold standard) and check before each new arc. Or just keep watching and skip ahead when the episode feels disconnected from the main story. You'll develop a sense for it fast.

### Route B (Canon + Best Filler)

Watch everything in Route A, plus these arcs that actually add something:

- **Episodes 57-71** (Twelve Guardian Ninja arc): Introduces concepts and characters that become relevant later. Feels like it belongs in the story.
- **Episodes 284-295** (Power arc): Visually impressive, and the narrative isn't bad. It was clearly given extra budget and attention.
- **Episodes 347-361** (Kakashi's ANBU arc): Fan-favorite filler. Fills in Kakashi's backstory in a way that makes his character richer. Many fans consider this "canon-adjacent" because it's consistent with manga hints.

### Route C (Completionist)

Watch 1-500 in order. Shippuden filler is generally better quality than original Naruto filler. Some arcs are genuinely entertaining even if they don't advance the main plot. But you'll add roughly 200 extra episodes to your watch time.

### Arc Checkpoints (Shippuden)

1. **Episodes 1-32** (Kazekage Rescue) - The "Shippuden is different" announcement. Everyone is older, stronger, and the villains are terrifying.
2. **Episodes 33-56** (Tenchi Bridge / Sasuke reunion) - The emotional gut punch of seeing Team 7's broken dynamic.
3. **Episodes 72-90 + 113-143** (Immortal Duo + Itachi Pursuit) - Peak escalation. The Akatsuki threat becomes real.
4. **Episodes 152-175** (Pain's Assault) - Arguably the best arc in the entire franchise. Episode 167 is legendary.
5. **Episodes 197-256** (Five Kage Summit + Start of War) - The scope explodes. International ninja politics.
6. **Episodes 261-393** (Fourth Great Ninja War) - The long one. Take breaks. Watch in sub-arcs.
7. **Episodes 414-479** (War conclusion + Naruto vs Sasuke) - Everything the series has been building toward.
8. **Episodes 484-500** (Epilogue arcs) - Wind-down episodes leading into The Last movie and Boruto.

The Fourth Great Ninja War is where most people's endurance gets tested. It's long, it's uneven, and it has more filler scattered through it than any other section. My advice: use the checkpoints, take breaks between sub-arcs, and remind yourself that the payoff in the final stretch is worth it.

## Naruto Movies: When to Watch Them

Here's the honest truth about Naruto movies: only two of them matter to the actual story. The rest are standalone adventures based on original scripts, not Kishimoto's manga. They're fun side quests, but skipping them won't leave any gaps in your understanding of the main story.

### Original Naruto Movies

| Movie | Watch After | Worth It? |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow | Episode 101 | Fun Team 7 adventure. Solid action. |
| Legend of the Stone of Gelel | Episode 160 | Weaker story. Skip unless completionist. |
| Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom | Episode 220 (end of Part I) | Decent send-off film for the Part I era. |

### Shippuden Movies

| Movie | Watch After | Worth It? |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Naruto Shippuden the Movie | Episode 32 | Action-heavy, plot-light. Fun but forgettable. |
| Bonds | Episode 71 | One of the better standalone films. |
| The Will of Fire | Episode 126 | Good character moments for the full cast. |
| The Lost Tower | Episode 143 | Time travel gimmick. Take it or leave it. |
| Blood Prison | Episode 196 | Interesting premise, execution is uneven. |
| Road to Ninja | Episode 251 | Fan-favorite. Alternate universe concept is creative. |
| **The Last: Naruto the Movie** | **Episode 493** | **CANON. Watch this one. Period.** |
| Boruto: Naruto the Movie | After Shippuden | Retold in the Boruto anime. Watch the show instead. |

**The Last: Naruto the Movie** is the only film that's genuinely canon to the story. Kishimoto wrote the story himself. It bridges Shippuden and the epilogue, develops a major relationship, and resolves things the series left open. Don't skip it.

**Road to Ninja** is the best non-canon film. It explores "what if" scenarios for the characters and has real emotional weight, especially for Naruto's backstory. If you watch one optional movie, make it that one.

## Should You Watch Boruto After Shippuden?

This is a loaded question in the anime community, so I'll be direct.

**Watch Boruto if:** You love the world and want to see the next generation. You're curious about Naruto and Sasuke as adults and fathers. You enjoyed the political and world-building elements of Shippuden.

**Skip Boruto if:** You watched Naruto primarily for Naruto's personal journey and feel satisfied by The Last movie's ending. You don't want to invest in another 293 episodes. You prefer the tone of the original series.

Boruto has a different energy. The stakes feel lower early on because the world is at peace. The new generation's problems are fundamentally different from Naruto's ("my dad is too busy being Hokage" versus "I'm an orphan with a demon sealed inside me"). It finds its footing eventually, but the road there tests your patience.

If you do watch Boruto, skip the movie (it's retold in episodes 53-66 of the anime) and start from episode 1. The anime-original content early on establishes the new characters better than jumping straight to the movie arc.

## Where to Watch Naruto in 2026

**Crunchyroll** is the most complete option. All three series (Naruto, Shippuden, Boruto), subbed and dubbed, plus every movie. If you only want one subscription, this is the one.

**Hulu** has Naruto and Shippuden with dubs, which makes it a strong choice if you prefer watching in English. Boruto is also available.

**Netflix** has Naruto (the original series) in select regions. Check your local library before assuming it's there.

**Peacock** carries the original Naruto series as well.

**My recommendation:** Pick Crunchyroll or Hulu and commit to one platform. Switching services mid-binge is a momentum killer, and when you're watching 700+ episodes, momentum is everything.

One practical tip: for a series this long, set a pace you can actually maintain. Three episodes a day (roughly an hour) gets you through the canon path in about four months. That's a marathon, not a sprint, and it's sustainable. Trying to blast through ten episodes a day leads to the burnout that makes people drop the series during the war arc.

## FAQ

### What is the correct Naruto watch order?

Naruto (original series, 220 episodes) then Naruto: Shippuden (500 episodes) then The Last: Naruto the Movie, then optionally Boruto. There's no timeline branching or alternate routes. The only decision is how much filler to include. See the three routes above.

### Can I skip Naruto filler episodes?

Yes, and for most people I'd recommend it. The canon story is complete without filler. In the original series, episodes 136-219 are all filler. In Shippuden, filler is scattered throughout but sites like animefillerlist.com track every episode. Route B above includes the filler arcs that are actually worth watching.

### How long does it take to watch all of Naruto?

At roughly 23 minutes per episode: the canon-only path (Route A) takes about 135 hours, or roughly 4.5 months at 1 hour per day. The completionist path (all 720 episodes) takes about 276 hours, or roughly 9 months at 1 hour per day. Add another 20 hours if you include all 11 movies.

### Do I need to watch the original Naruto before Shippuden?

Yes. Shippuden assumes you know the characters, their relationships, the world's rules, and what happened in Part I. Starting with Shippuden would be like starting a book at chapter 30. The original series does the heavy lifting of making you care about these people.

### Is the Naruto dub good?

It's solid. The English voice cast spent over a decade in these roles and grew into them. Maile Flanagan's Naruto can be polarizing early on (the voice is... distinctive), but it fits the character's energy perfectly, and her emotional range in Shippuden is impressive. If you prefer dubs, you won't miss anything essential by watching dubbed.

### When does Naruto get good?

Most fans point to the **Land of Waves arc (episodes 6-19)** as the moment the show reveals what it's capable of, and the **Chunin Exams (episodes 20-67)** as where it becomes genuinely great. If you've watched through episode 25 and aren't feeling it, the show probably isn't for you. If you're on the fence after episode 19, push through to the Chunin Exams before deciding.
