Every Dragon Ball watch guide on the internet gives you the same thing: a chronological list of 40+ entries interleaving series, movies, specials, and OVAs until your eyes glaze over and you close the tab without watching anything. IGN does it. GamesRadar does it. RadioTimes does it. They're not wrong, exactly. They're just not helpful.

Here's what nobody tells you: watching Dragon Ball isn't actually complicated. There are really only three decisions you need to make, and once you make them, the path forward is completely linear. I'm going to walk you through each one so you can stop researching and start watching.

The first time I tried to explain Dragon Ball to a friend who wanted to get into it, I watched his face go blank when I said "around 800 episodes across seven series." That number sounds insane. But the truth is, depending on the route you choose, you might only need 200 episodes to get the full experience. Or 460 for the definitive journey. Or yeah, all 800 if you're that person. No judgment.

Let's figure out which person you are.

## The Quick Answer: 3 Routes Through Dragon Ball

Before we get into the details, here's the overview. Pick your route, then read the sections below for specifics on each decision point.

**Route 1: The Complete Journey** (for fans who want everything)
Dragon Ball > Dragon Ball Z > Dragon Ball Super > DBS: Broly > DBS: Super Hero > Dragon Ball Daima > DBS: Beerus (Fall 2026)
~595 episodes + 4 movies. Estimated watch time: ~250 hours.

**Route 2: The Modern Fast Track** (skip the filler, respect your time)
Dragon Ball > Dragon Ball Z Kai > Dragon Ball Super > DBS: Broly > DBS: Super Hero > Dragon Ball Daima
~463 episodes + 2 movies. Estimated watch time: ~190 hours.

**Route 3: The Greatest Hits Express** (just give me the good stuff)
Dragon Ball eps 1-28 > Dragon Ball Z Kai > DBS from ep 77 (Tournament of Power) > DBS: Broly
~240 episodes + 1 movie. Estimated watch time: ~100 hours.

Route 2 is my recommendation for first-timers. You get the complete story with none of the filler bloat. But all three routes are valid depending on what you want out of the experience. Let me explain what goes into each choice.

## What Each Dragon Ball Series Actually Is (No Spoilers)

Seven series. Forty years. One franchise. Here's what you're looking at:

**Dragon Ball (1986-1989) - 153 episodes.** The original. Kid Goku wanders the world searching for magical wish-granting orbs, enters martial arts tournaments, and gets into increasingly wild adventures. The tone is comedy-adventure with genuine heart. Think Indiana Jones meets martial arts manga. Most people don't realize Dragon Ball started as a gag manga inspired by Journey to the West. This is where the soul of the franchise lives, and skipping it entirely means missing context that pays off decades later.

**Dragon Ball Z (1989-1996) - 291 episodes.** The one everyone knows. Goku is an adult, aliens show up, power levels become a meme, and the scale escalates from "martial arts tournament" to "fighting gods who can destroy galaxies." The Saiyan Saga, Frieza Saga, Cell Saga, and Buu Saga each feel like their own show within a show. Iconic doesn't begin to cover it. But roughly 40% of Z is filler: episodes that weren't in Toriyama's original manga, added to keep the anime from catching up to the weekly manga serialization. This is where the Z vs. Kai decision matters, and I'll break that down in its own section.

**Dragon Ball Z Kai (2009-2015) - 159 episodes.** Z remastered and recut with the filler removed. Same story, same characters, same arcs. 132 fewer episodes. If you've never seen Z before, this is the version you should watch. I'll explain why below and what you'd be giving up.

**Dragon Ball GT (1996-1997) - 64 episodes.** The controversial one. GT is NOT based on Toriyama's manga. It was an anime-original continuation made by Toei Animation after Z ended. It features kid Goku again (long story), space travel, and Super Saiyan 4, a transformation with a devoted fanbase. GT is divisive because the writing quality is inconsistent, but it has moments of genuine brilliance. More on its weird canon status later.

**Dragon Ball Super (2015-2018) - 131 episodes.** The official continuation, set between the Buu Saga and the end of Z. Gods of Destruction, the multiverse, and the Tournament of Power, which is one of the most hype arcs in the entire franchise. Super's early episodes are rough (the first two arcs are retellings of movies with worse animation), but from the Universe 6 Tournament onward, it finds its stride.

**Dragon Ball Daima (2024-2025) - 20 episodes.** Toriyama's final project, which he was developing before his passing in March 2024. Goku and friends get turned into mini versions of themselves and explore the Demon Realm. It's short, it's canon, and it's a love letter to the original Dragon Ball's adventure spirit. The animation quality is gorgeous.

**Dragon Ball Super: Beerus (Fall 2026) - UPCOMING.** Announced January 25, 2026, at the Dragon Ball 40th anniversary event. This is an enhanced, remastered version of the God of Destruction Beerus Saga from Super with new and redrawn animation. Not just an upscale. Production reportedly started years ago. Think of it as Dragon Ball Super getting the Kai treatment. Expected to lead into a Galactic Patrol arc in 2027 or 2028.

## The Z vs. Kai Decision (This Is the One That Matters)

This is the fork in the road that actually changes your experience. Everything else is straightforward. This one requires a real choice.

Dragon Ball Z has 291 episodes. Dragon Ball Z Kai has 159. Same plot, same characters, same saga structure. Kai cuts approximately 130 episodes of anime-original filler content and tightens the pacing to match Toriyama's manga more closely.

**What you get with Z that Kai doesn't have:**

The original Funimation dub performances in their full uncut form. Bruce Faulconer's American rock score, which is dramatically different from the Japanese soundtrack and defines Z for an entire generation of Western fans. Filler arcs and episodes that, while not canon, have become beloved in their own right: the Garlic Jr. Saga, Goku and Piccolo learning to drive, the Otherworld Tournament, Gregory the cricket. A certain pacing that lets moments breathe (for better and worse).

**What you get with Kai:**

Tighter pacing that respects your time. A remastered visual presentation. A translation that's closer to the original Japanese. Kenji Yamamoto's score (later replaced with Shunsuke Kikuchi's classic BGM after a plagiarism controversy, but both work). No stretches where you're watching five episodes of charging a single attack. The story Toriyama actually wrote, presented without padding.

Here's my honest take: if you've never seen Dragon Ball Z before, watch Kai. It's the better-paced, more faithful adaptation, and it'll get you through the same story in roughly half the time. You can always go back and watch specific Z-only episodes or arcs later if you want the filler content.

If you grew up on Z and you're rewatching, stick with Z. The Faulconer score, the extended moments, the filler you watched as a kid on Toonami. That's your Dragon Ball. Kai can feel like it's rushing through a story you remember unfolding slowly and dramatically. Nostalgia is valid.

If you're watching Z and want to skip filler: the major filler blocks are episodes 108-117 (Garlic Jr.), episodes 125-127, episodes 170-171, episodes 195-199 (Otherworld Tournament), and a scattering of single filler episodes throughout. AnimeFillerList.com has the complete breakdown by episode.

## Where Do the Movies Fit? (Canon vs. Non-Canon Breakdown)

Dragon Ball has over 20 theatrical films across its history. The vast majority are non-canon side stories that don't fit into the timeline at all. They're fun popcorn entertainment, but you don't need them for the story.

**The 4 canon movies you should actually watch:**

1. **Battle of Gods (2013)** - Beerus, the God of Destruction, arrives on Earth. Goku unlocks Super Saiyan God. This is where Dragon Ball Super begins its story. However, DBS episodes 1-14 retell this movie's plot. So you can watch the movie and skip those episodes, OR skip the movie and watch the episodes. The movie has better animation. The episodes have more character moments.

2. **Resurrection F (2015)** - Frieza comes back. Again. DBS episodes 15-27 retell this one too. Same deal: watch the movie or the episodes, not both.

3. **DBS: Broly (2018)** - MUST WATCH. Takes place after DBS episode 131. Introduces the canon version of Broly (previous Broly movies were non-canon). The animation in this movie is on another level. It sets up continuity that carries into Super Hero and beyond.

4. **DBS: Super Hero (2022)** - Takes place after Broly. Focuses on Gohan and Piccolo rather than Goku and Vegeta. Uses a CGI animation style that was divisive but works better than you'd expect. Watch it after DBS.

**Non-canon movies worth your time if you want more:**

- *Bardock: The Father of Goku* (1990 TV special) - Goku's father's story. Emotionally devastating. Watch anytime after learning about Saiyans in Z.
- *The History of Trunks* (1993 TV special) - Future Trunks' backstory. Watch after he appears in the Cell Saga.
- *Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan* (1993) - The original non-canon Broly. Fun, over-the-top action. Watch after the Cell Saga.

Everything else is optional bonus content. The Path to Power (1996) is a nice retelling of early Dragon Ball, and Wrath of the Dragon (1995) has some cool Trunks moments, but none of them are essential.

## The GT Question: Skip It or Watch It?

I'm going to be straight with you: there is no consensus on GT, and anyone who tells you there is hasn't been paying attention to Dragon Ball discussions for the past 30 years.

GT is not based on Toriyama's manga. It was Toei Animation's original continuation after Z ended. Toriyama provided some character designs and general supervision, but the story was written by the anime staff. Dragon Ball Super later came along and effectively replaced GT's timeline as the official continuation.

So in terms of canon: GT is not part of the main timeline. Super replaces it. Full stop.

But here's where it gets interesting. Daima brought back the Demon Realm in a significant way, and some fans have argued that Daima retroactively validates certain GT concepts (the Demon Realm was explored in GT as well). Whether that amounts to "re-canonization" is debatable, but it's worth noting if you're the kind of person who cares about this stuff.

GT also gave us Super Saiyan 4, a transformation that has never appeared in the Super continuity but remains a fan favorite. SSJ4's design is genuinely cool and completely different from Super's god forms.

**My recommendation:** If you're doing Route 1 or 2 and you've finished Z/Kai and want more Dragon Ball before jumping to Super, watch GT. It's only 64 episodes, the Baby Saga and Shadow Dragon Saga have real high points, and you might love it. If you're doing Route 3 or just want to follow the canon timeline, skip it entirely. You won't miss anything that Super requires.

If you do watch GT, slot it after Z/Kai and before Super. In production order, GT came first. In continuity, Super replaces its timeline, so watching GT after Super creates contradictions. Better to watch GT, enjoy it for what it is, then move into Super as the "real" continuation.

## The Complete Chronological Timeline

Here's the full canon order with everything in its proper place. This is for Route 1 and 2 viewers who want the definitive sequence.

1. **Dragon Ball** (episodes 1-153)
2. **Dragon Ball Z / Z Kai** (Saiyan Saga through Frieza Saga)
3. *Bardock: The Father of Goku* (optional TV special, watch anytime after learning about Saiyans)
4. **Dragon Ball Z / Z Kai** (Cell Saga)
5. *The History of Trunks* (optional TV special, watch after Trunks appears)
6. **Dragon Ball Z / Z Kai** (Buu Saga, through end)
7. **Battle of Gods** (movie) OR **DBS episodes 1-14** (pick one)
8. **Resurrection F** (movie) OR **DBS episodes 15-27** (pick one)
9. **Dragon Ball Super** (episodes 28-131)
10. **DBS: Broly** (movie)
11. **DBS: Super Hero** (movie)
12. **Dragon Ball Daima** (episodes 1-20)
13. **Dragon Ball Super: Beerus** (Fall 2026, upcoming)

**Approximate watch times by route:**
- Route 1 (Z path): ~250 hours
- Route 2 (Kai path): ~190 hours
- Route 3 (Greatest Hits): ~100 hours

Pro tip: take breaks between sagas. Dragon Ball is a marathon, and every saga has a natural stopping point where the story wraps up before the next threat appears. Powering through 100 episodes without a breather is how you burn out on a franchise that's meant to be enjoyed.

## Where to Watch Dragon Ball in 2026

**Crunchyroll** has the most complete library: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super, Daima, and most of the movies. If you're picking one streaming service for this, it's Crunchyroll.

**Hulu** carries Z Kai and Daima, plus select other Dragon Ball content.

**Netflix** has Daima and a rotating selection of Dragon Ball titles depending on your region.

**Physical media** is worth mentioning because Dragon Ball's Blu-ray box sets are genuinely good. The Dragon Box sets (if you can find them) are considered the definitive releases. Newer season sets from Funimation/Crunchyroll are widely available.

**Sub or dub?** Both are excellent options for Dragon Ball, which is unusual. The Funimation English dub cast (Sean Schemmel as Goku, Christopher Sabat as Vegeta) defined these characters for Western audiences and delivered genuinely iconic performances. The Japanese cast with Masako Nozawa voicing Goku from 1986 through Daima is one of the most legendary performances in anime history. Pick whichever you'll stick with for the long haul. Consistency matters more than "correctness" when you're committing to hundreds of episodes.

## Dragon Ball Super: Beerus - What We Know About Fall 2026

This is the part no other watch guide is covering yet because it was just announced.

On January 25, 2026, at the Dragon Ball 40th anniversary event, Toei Animation revealed Dragon Ball Super: Beerus. It's an enhanced, remastered version of the God of Destruction Beerus Saga from Super's early run, featuring new and redrawn animation cuts rather than just an upscale of existing footage.

This matters because Super's first two arcs (the Battle of Gods retelling and the Resurrection F retelling) are widely considered the weakest part of the series. The animation was inconsistent, the pacing was off, and they were retreading movies that told the same story better. DBS: Beerus is essentially Toei going back and fixing that with modern production quality.

According to producer Akio Iyoku, production started years ago. The project is expected to lead into an adaptation of the Galactic Patrol arc (the Moro and Granolah storylines from the Super manga), potentially arriving in 2027 or 2028.

For your watch order: DBS: Beerus will slot in after Daima. When it releases, you'll be able to replace DBS episodes 1-14 (or the Battle of Gods movie) with this superior version and continue from there. I'll update this guide when we have a confirmed release date and streaming details.

## FAQ

**What order should I watch Dragon Ball in?**
Start with the original Dragon Ball, then Z or Z Kai, then Dragon Ball Super, then the movies (Broly and Super Hero), then Daima. See the three routes above for tailored paths based on your available time.

**Should I watch Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball Z Kai?**
First-timers should watch Kai. It tells the same story in 159 episodes instead of 291 by cutting filler. If you grew up on Z and you're rewatching for nostalgia, stick with Z for the Faulconer score and extended moments.

**Is Dragon Ball GT canon?**
No. GT was an anime-original continuation not based on Toriyama's manga. Dragon Ball Super replaced its timeline as the official continuation. GT is still enjoyable on its own and worth watching if you want more Dragon Ball, but it's not part of the main story.

**How many episodes of Dragon Ball are there total?**
Across all seven series: 818 episodes (Dragon Ball 153, Z 291, Kai 159, GT 64, Super 131, Daima 20). The canon path using Kai instead of Z totals around 463 episodes.

**Where does Dragon Ball Daima fit in the timeline?**
Daima takes place after Dragon Ball Super and after the DBS: Super Hero movie. It's set before the end-of-Z epilogue. Watch it after Super Hero and before the upcoming DBS: Beerus.

**Do I need to watch the Dragon Ball movies?**
Only four are canon: Battle of Gods, Resurrection F, DBS: Broly, and DBS: Super Hero. Of those, Broly is the most essential. Battle of Gods and Resurrection F are retold in Super's early episodes, so you can watch the movies or the episodes.

**What is Dragon Ball Super: Beerus?**
A newly announced enhanced/remastered version of Dragon Ball Super's God of Destruction Beerus Saga, featuring redrawn animation. Announced January 25, 2026, for a Fall 2026 release. Think of it as Super getting the Kai treatment.

**Can I skip the original Dragon Ball and start with Z?**
You can, and many people have. Z is designed to work as an entry point. But Dragon Ball adds important context for Goku's character, his relationships with Krillin, Bulma, Master Roshi, and the origin of the franchise's core themes. If you're doing Route 3 (Greatest Hits), watching at least the first 28 episodes gives you the foundation.

**How long does it take to watch all of Dragon Ball?**
At standard speed with no breaks: Route 1 (complete with Z) takes roughly 250 hours, Route 2 (with Kai) takes roughly 190 hours, and Route 3 (greatest hits) takes roughly 100 hours. At 2-3 episodes per day, Route 2 takes about 6 months.

**Where can I watch Dragon Ball in 2026?**
Crunchyroll has the most complete library. Hulu carries Z Kai and Daima. Netflix has Daima and select titles. Physical Blu-ray box sets are available for collectors.
