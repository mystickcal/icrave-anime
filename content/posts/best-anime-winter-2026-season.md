Winter 2026 is stacked. We've got blockbuster sequels, highly anticipated adaptations, and at least two shows that came out of nowhere to dominate the conversation.

Here's everything worth watching this season, ranked by how much we think you should prioritize them.

## S Tier: Must Watch

### 1. Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Season 2

**Studio:** Madhouse | **Episodes:** 24 (ongoing) | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

If you watched Season 1 and somehow haven't started Season 2, what are you doing? Frieren continues to be the most thoughtful, beautifully animated show in anime. The pacing is deliberate, the character writing is exceptional, and every episode feels like a short film.

Season 2 picks up right where we left off, expanding the world and deepening Frieren's understanding of human connection. The magic system continues to be one of the most creative in modern anime.

**Watch if you like:** Made in Abyss, Mushishi, Violet Evergarden

### 2. My Hero Academia: Vigilantes

**Studio:** Bones | **Episodes:** 13 | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

The MHA spin-off that fans have been begging for. Vigilantes takes place before the main series and follows Koichi Haimawari, a regular guy who becomes an underground hero. The tone is grittier and more street-level than the main show.

If you were frustrated with how MHA ended, Vigilantes is a reminder of what made this universe great. Excellent fight choreography and a protagonist who earns every power-up.

**Watch if you like:** Tiger & Bunny, One Punch Man, mob-level hero stories

## A Tier: Highly Recommended

### 3. Journal With Witch

**Studio:** MAPPA | **Episodes:** 12 | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

This season's dark horse. Nobody saw this coming, and now it's dominating social media. A witch travels through a dying world, documenting what she finds in her journal. Think Kino's Journey meets Witch Hat Atelier.

The art direction is stunning, the worldbuilding is subtle but deep, and each episode functions as a self-contained story while building toward something larger. This is the kind of show that wins anime of the year awards.

**Watch if you like:** Kino's Journey, Mushishi, Girls' Last Tour

### 4. Solo Leveling Season 2

**Studio:** A-1 Pictures | **Episodes:** 13 | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

Sung Jinwoo continues his ascent from weakest hunter to absolute menace. Season 2 adapts the Jeju Island arc, which is where Solo Leveling goes from "fun power fantasy" to "actually compelling stakes."

The animation budget is clearly massive, and the fight scenes are even better than Season 1. If you bounced off the first season for being too much of a power trip, Season 2 adds enough tension to keep it interesting.

**Watch if you like:** Sword Art Online (but better), Overlord, The Beginning After the End

### 5. Dandadan Season 2

**Studio:** Science SARU | **Episodes:** 12 | **Streaming:** Netflix

Season 1 was a wild ride and Season 2 doesn't slow down. Dandadan continues to be the most creatively unhinged shonen currently airing. Aliens, ghosts, and high school drama collide in ways that shouldn't work but absolutely do.

Science SARU's animation continues to push boundaries. Every episode has at least one sequence that makes you rewind.

**Watch if you like:** Mob Psycho 100, Chainsaw Man, shows that refuse to stay in one genre

## B Tier: Worth Your Time

### 6. Sakamoto Days Season 1

**Studio:** TMS Entertainment | **Episodes:** 11 | **Streaming:** Netflix

A retired hitman who now runs a convenience store gets dragged back into the assassination world. Sakamoto Days is pure fun, with slick action sequences and great comedy. Think John Wick as a slice-of-life anime.

### 7. Dr. Stone: Science Future

**Studio:** TMS Entertainment | **Episodes:** 11 | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

The final season of Dr. Stone. If you've been following Senku's quest to rebuild civilization through science, this wraps it up. Satisfying conclusion.

### 8. Apothecary Diaries Season 2

**Studio:** TOHO Animation | **Episodes:** 24 (ongoing) | **Streaming:** Crunchyroll

Maomao continues to solve mysteries in the imperial court using pharmaceutical knowledge. Season 2 raises the political stakes while keeping the character dynamics that made Season 1 a hit.

## C Tier: Niche but Good

### 9. The Ancient Magus' Bride Season 3

Slower paced but gorgeous. If you loved the first season's fairy tale atmosphere, this delivers more of it.

### 10. Classroom of the Elite Year 3

The mind games continue. If you're invested in Ayanokoji's schemes, you'll eat this up. If you bounced off previous seasons, this won't change your mind.

## How to Watch Everything Without Losing Your Mind

Here's a realistic schedule for keeping up with seasonal anime:

- **Sunday:** Frieren, Vigilantes
- **Wednesday:** Solo Leveling, Journal With Witch
- **Friday:** Dandadan, Sakamoto Days
- **Catch-up day:** Saturday for anything you missed

That's roughly 3 hours per week for the top 6 shows. Very doable.

## The Bottom Line

Winter 2026 is a great season. Frieren Season 2 is the obvious headliner, but Journal With Witch is the show everyone will be talking about in hindsight. Don't sleep on it.

If you can only watch three shows: **Frieren, Journal With Witch, and Vigilantes.** Everything else is a bonus.
