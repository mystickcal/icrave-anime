Iruma's heading back to the Netherworld this April. After three seasons of demon school chaos, **Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun Season 4** has an April 2026 release window locked in on [LiveChart](https://www.livechart.me/) and [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/). No exact premiere date yet, but the timing puts it squarely in the spring 2026 lineup alongside the season's other heavy hitters.

If you've been tracking the [spring 2026 anime schedule](/posts/spring-2026-anime-schedule-guide/), you know April's stacked. Iruma-kun Season 4 joins the wave of sequels and originals fighting for your watch time. Here's everything confirmed so far.

## April 2026 Release Window Confirmed

Both LiveChart and MyAnimeList list **Mairimashita! Iruma-kun Season 4** with an April 2026 air date. The exact premiere day hasn't dropped yet, but April windows typically mean early-to-mid-month debuts for continuing series. NHK hasn't announced the specific date, so expect that confirmation closer to March.

This lines up with the [spring 2026 anime forecast](/posts/spring-2026-anime-forecast/) we covered last month. The season's loaded with sequels, and Iruma-kun's one of the few family-friendly shonen comedies in the mix. If past seasons are any guide, expect Saturday morning slots for maximum accessibility.

## What's Season 4 About? Music Festival Arc Incoming

Season 4 adapts the **Music Festival arc**, one of the manga's most beloved storylines. According to LiveChart's description, the demon students of Babyls are preparing for a massive cultural festival where music takes center stage. Iruma and his misfit class tackle band formation, instrument training, and all the drama that comes with putting on a school-wide concert.

The arc's a fan favorite for good reason. It shifts focus from combat rankings to creative collaboration, giving underused characters room to shine. Expect Clara's chaos energy, Azz's overprotective devotion, and Iruma's accidental genius to collide in new ways. The Music Festival arc also pushes Iruma's relationship with Ameri forward, so shippers have plenty to look forward to.

If you're manga-only, you already know how wild this gets. If you're anime-only, buckle up for concert prep montages, demon rock bands, and at least one emotional breakdown per episode.

## Where to Watch Iruma-kun Season 4

Streaming details aren't official yet. **TBA for now.** Seasons 1-3 streamed on Crunchyroll in most regions, so that's the safest bet for Season 4's simulcast. We'll update this post the second NHK or Crunchyroll confirm distribution rights.

In the meantime, you can rewatch Seasons 1-3 on Crunchyroll to prep for April. If you're in a region where Crunchyroll doesn't carry Iruma-kun, check your local anime streaming platforms for licensing updates as we get closer to premiere week.

## What to Do While You Wait

**Rewatch Seasons 1-3:** All three seasons are on Crunchyroll. Season 3 ended with Iruma's new rank and the setup for the Music Festival arc, so a refresher on where everyone stands will pay off.

**Read the Manga:** Season 4 adapts chapters starting around **volume 15-16** of the manga. If you can't wait for the anime, grab the volumes on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/PRODUCTID?tag=icraveanime-20) (*affiliate link*). The manga's pacing is tighter, and you'll get the full Music Festival experience months ahead of the broadcast.

**Physical Media:** Seasons 1-3 Blu-rays are available for import on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/PRODUCTID?tag=icraveanime-20) (*affiliate link*) if you want the collection. English Blu-ray releases are region-dependent, so double-check compatibility before buying.

**Set Reminders:** Follow the official [Iruma-kun Twitter](https://twitter.com/NHK_IRUMA) for trailer drops and exact premiere date announcements. NHK typically reveals the date 3-4 weeks before air, so mid-to-late March is the window to watch.

**Catch Up on Spring 2026:** Check out our [winter 2026 anime sequels guide](/posts/winter-2026-anime-sequels-guide/) to see what's wrapping up before Iruma-kun kicks off. Planning your spring watchlist now saves you from decision paralysis in April.
