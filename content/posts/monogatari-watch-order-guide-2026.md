Monogatari watch order is the final boss of anime watch orders.

People will throw charts at you like you are filing taxes. You do not need that. You need one clean path that gets you watching, plus a backup plan if you get curious later.

## Quick Answer: Best Monogatari Watch Order for Beginners (2026)

This is the simplest order that works for most first time viewers. It follows the story flow that makes the reveals land clean, and it puts **Kizumonogatari** where it hits the hardest.

1. **Bakemonogatari**
2. **Kizumonogatari I, II, III** (the movie trilogy)
3. **Nisemonogatari**
4. **Nekomonogatari: Kuro**
5. **Monogatari Series: Second Season**
6. **Hanamonogatari**
7. **Tsukimonogatari**
8. **Owarimonogatari**
9. **Koyomimonogatari**
10. **Owarimonogatari Season 2**
11. **Zoku Owarimonogatari**

If you want another franchise with a clean numbered path, use our [Fate watch order guide](/posts/fate-watch-order-guide-2026/).

## Why This Order Works (Without Overthinking It)

- **Bake** is the hook. If Bake does not work for you, nothing else will.
- **Kizu** explains the foundation of Araragi and Shinobu. Watching it early makes later arcs feel way less confusing.
- **Second Season** is where the series turns from "this is clever" into "oh, this is actually insane."
- The end stretch (Owari, Koyomi, Owari 2, Zoku) is payoff stacked on payoff.

## The Full Monogatari Anime Release Order (For Completionists)

If you prefer to watch in the order the anime aired and released, here is the simplified release order list.

1. Bakemonogatari
2. Nisemonogatari
3. Nekomonogatari: Kuro
4. Monogatari Series: Second Season
5. Hanamonogatari
6. Tsukimonogatari
7. Owarimonogatari
8. Koyomimonogatari
9. Kizumonogatari I, II, III (released later than you would expect)
10. Owarimonogatari Season 2
11. Zoku Owarimonogatari

This order is valid, but it is not what I would recommend for most beginners because Kizu lands better earlier.

## "Where Does Kizumonogatari Go?"

If you only remember one rule from this guide, remember this:

1. If you are new, watch Kizu right after Bake.
2. If you are a completionist doing strict release order, watch Kizu where it released.

That is it. Do not let Reddit steal your Saturday.

## Optional Paths (If You Want to Get Fancy)

### Option A: A "Start Fast" version

If you are the kind of person who bounces off slow starts, this can help:

1. Bakemonogatari
2. Kizumonogatari trilogy
3. Jump straight to Monogatari Series: Second Season
4. Go back for Nisemonogatari and Neko: Kuro later

I do not recommend this for everyone, but it works for some people.

### Option B: Chronological order (Only for a rewatch)

Chronological order exists, but it is better as a second pass. Monogatari is built around perspective and reveals, so strict chronology can flatten the mystery.

If you are rewatching: use the beginner path first, then look up a detailed chronological playlist and treat it like a remix, not the main course.

## FAQ

### What is the best Monogatari watch order for beginners?

Start with **Bakemonogatari**, then watch the **Kizumonogatari** trilogy, then continue forward (Nise, Neko: Kuro, Second Season, and so on).

### Can I skip Kizumonogatari?

You can, but you will be missing a lot of emotional context for later arcs. It is worth it.

### Should I watch Monogatari in release order or story order?

For a first watch, use the beginner path in this guide. Save strict release order or chronological order for a rewatch.

### Is Hanamonogatari supposed to be watched later?

Some guides place it later. Watching it after Second Season is a clean, common approach that keeps the pacing sensible.

### Is Monogatari actually good, or is it just weird?

Both. It is stylish, funny, and surprisingly emotional, and it is also absolutely not normal.
