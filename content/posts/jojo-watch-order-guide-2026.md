Steel Ball Run is coming to Netflix on March 19, 2026. Manga readers have been calling it the best JoJo part for over a decade. And right now, at this exact moment, you have roughly one month to catch up on 190 episodes of one of the most unique, creative, and genuinely bizarre anime franchises ever made.

That's what brought you here, right? Either the internet won't stop talking about JoJo, your friends keep sending you memes you don't understand, or you saw the Steel Ball Run trailer and something clicked. Whatever the reason, you're looking at six animated parts spanning 2012 to 2022, a fanbase that communicates almost entirely through references, and a power system where one character's ability is literally just being a zipper.

The first time I tried watching JoJo, I almost dropped it after three episodes of Phantom Blood. Victorian England? Vampires? A protagonist named Jonathan who's essentially a polite brick wall? It felt like a completely different show from everything the fandom raves about. Then I hit Battle Tendency and Joseph Joestar outsmarted a god by running away, and I understood. JoJo isn't one show. It's six wildly different shows connected by a bloodline and a willingness to get genuinely, unapologetically weird.

Here's your plan to experience all of it before March 19. Or, if time is tight, a shortcut that actually works.

## Quick Answer: The Complete JoJo Watch Order

For those who just want the list and will figure out the rest themselves:

1. **Part 1: Phantom Blood** (9 episodes)
2. **Part 2: Battle Tendency** (17 episodes)
3. **Part 3: Stardust Crusaders** (48 episodes)
4. **Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable** (39 episodes)
5. **Part 5: Golden Wind** (39 episodes)
6. **Part 6: Stone Ocean** (38 episodes)
7. **Part 7: Steel Ball Run** (Netflix, March 19, 2026)

Total before Steel Ball Run: 190 episodes. About 80 hours of anime. Release order and chronological order are the same for Parts 1 through 6, which makes this mercifully simple compared to franchises like [Fate](/posts/fate-watch-order-guide-2026/) or [Monogatari](/posts/monogatari-watch-order-guide-2026/).

Now, if "190 episodes in a month" made your stomach drop, keep reading. I've got routes for that.

## 3 Routes Into JoJo (Pick Based on Your Timeline)

Not everyone has the same amount of time before March 19. Not everyone needs to see every single episode. Here's the framework I use when recommending JoJo to people, based on how many weeks they've got and what they care about.

### Route 1: The Full Bizarre Experience (190 episodes)

**Time commitment:** ~80 hours. About 4 weeks at 3 episodes per day, or 2.5 weeks if you're binging 5-6 per day.

**Who this is for:** You want the complete journey. Every Stand, every meme, every "is this a JoJo reference?" moment explained. You're not in a rush, or you're willing to make JoJo your entire personality for the next month.

**The path:** Part 1 through Part 6 in order. No skipping, no shortcuts. You'll hit slow stretches (early Stardust Crusaders, some Stone Ocean pacing issues) but you'll also experience every iconic moment the way Araki intended.

**What you gain:** Full context for Steel Ball Run's alternate-universe parallels. Every callback will land. You'll understand why the fanbase loses its mind over characters who share names with Part 1-6 characters but exist in completely different circumstances.

### Route 2: The Fast Track (190 episodes, but with strategy)

**Time commitment:** Same episode count, but with a pacing strategy that prevents burnout. 3 weeks if you're disciplined about 3-4 episodes per day.

**Who this is for:** You want to see everything, but you've heard the pacing can be rough in places and you want to know when to push through versus when to slow down.

**The path:** All six parts in order, but with these pacing adjustments:

- **Part 1 (9 eps):** Watch in 2-3 sittings. It's short enough that momentum carries you through. Don't judge JoJo by Part 1 alone.
- **Part 2 (17 eps):** Let yourself binge. This is where JoJo clicks for most people. Joseph is magnetic. You'll probably finish this in two days.
- **Part 3 (48 eps):** Here's where people stall out. The first half (episodes 1-24, the journey TO Egypt) has a "monster of the week" format that can feel repetitive. Push through to the Egypt arc (episode 25 onward). If a specific Stand fight isn't grabbing you, it's okay to watch at 1.5x speed. The D'Arby gambling episodes and the final DIO confrontation are worth every slow episode before them.
- **Part 4 (39 eps):** Completely different vibe. Small town, serial killer mystery, slice-of-life between Stand battles. Let it breathe. This one rewards slower watching.
- **Part 5 (39 eps):** Pure momentum. Italian mafia, betrayals, some of the most creative Stands in the series. This part basically watches itself.
- **Part 6 (38 eps):** The Netflix batch structure actually helps here. Stone Ocean's pacing is uneven but the ending is one of the most ambitious things any anime has ever attempted. Don't read spoilers.

**What you gain:** Everything from Route 1, plus you won't burn out in the Stardust Crusaders middle stretch, which is where most first-timers quit.

### Route 3: The Steel Ball Run Sprint (~74 episodes)

**Time commitment:** ~31 hours. About 2 weeks at 3 episodes per day, or one intense week of binging.

**Who this is for:** You have limited time before March 19, you mainly care about being ready for Steel Ball Run, and you're willing to accept some trade-offs.

**The path:** Part 1 (9 eps) + Part 2 (17 eps) + Part 6: Stone Ocean (38 eps) + a 10-minute lore summary for Parts 3-5.

**Wait, what?** I know. This is controversial. The JoJo community's number one rule is "never skip parts." And they're right, in an ideal world. But here's the thing about Steel Ball Run: it takes place in an alternate universe. It's set in 1890s America during a cross-country horse race. The characters are alternate versions of characters from earlier parts, but the story is completely standalone.

So why include Parts 1, 2, and 6? Part 1 establishes the Joestar vs. DIO dynamic that Steel Ball Run reimagines. Part 2 introduces the broader Joestar bloodline philosophy. And Stone Ocean's ending is literally the reason the alternate universe exists. These three parts give you the thematic foundation that makes Steel Ball Run's parallels meaningful.

**What you lose:** Parts 3, 4, and 5 contain some of the franchise's best moments. Jotaro vs. DIO. Yoshikage Kira. The entire Golden Wind experience. You can always go back for these after Steel Ball Run, but know that you're trading immediate context for time savings.

**What you keep:** The core Joestar legacy. The DIO connection. The reason this alternate universe exists. And honestly, enough to follow and enjoy Steel Ball Run on its own merits.

## Every JoJo Part Explained (So You Know What You're Getting Into)

JoJo is uniquely structured among long-running anime. Each part has a different protagonist, a different setting, a different tone, and often a different genre entirely. The only constants are the Joestar bloodline, the bizarre situations they find themselves in, and creator Hirohiko Araki's relentless commitment to pushing his story into stranger and stranger territory.

### Part 1: Phantom Blood (9 episodes, 2012)

Set in 1880s England. Jonathan Joestar, a nobleman's son, has his life destroyed by his adopted brother Dio Brando, who eventually becomes a vampire. Yes, a vampire. The tone is gothic horror meets Victorian melodrama, and the power system here is Hamon (a breathing-based technique, not Stands).

Phantom Blood is the hill JoJo's reputation has to climb. It's slower, it's more traditional, and Jonathan is the most straightforward protagonist in the entire franchise. He's earnest, noble, and kind in a way that feels old-fashioned compared to the tricksters and schemers who come later.

But here's what Part 1 actually does: it establishes the Joestar-Brando conflict that echoes through every single part that follows. Dio isn't just a villain. He's an idea. He's the shadow on the Joestar bloodline that persists across generations, continents, and eventually universes. You need nine episodes of Victorian gothic horror to understand why DIO showing up in Part 3 makes an entire generation of anime fans lose their composure.

Nine episodes. That's about four hours. You can do this.

### Part 2: Battle Tendency (17 episodes, 2012-2013)

Set in 1938. Joseph Joestar (Jonathan's grandson) is everything Jonathan wasn't: loud, cocky, a cheater, a trash-talker, and absolutely hilarious. He fights ancient Aztec super-beings called the Pillar Men while teaming up with a Nazi cyborg (the 1930s setting is doing a lot of work here).

This is where people fall in love with JoJo. Joseph's personality is infectious. He doesn't fight fair. He doesn't win through raw power. He wins by reading his opponents, bluffing, and pulling plans out of nowhere that somehow work despite making no logical sense. His "Your next line is..." trick is one of the most iconic recurring bits in anime.

Battle Tendency is also where Araki's love of Western music references starts bleeding into character names. The Pillar Men are named after fashion brands (Wamuu, Esidisi, Kars), and this only escalates from here. By Part 5, you'll have characters named after Aerosmith, Metallica, and King Crimson.

### Part 3: Stardust Crusaders (48 episodes, 2014-2015)

Set in 1987-1988. Jotaro Kujo (Joseph's grandson) discovers he has a Stand, a manifestation of his fighting spirit that takes physical form. DIO, the vampire from Part 1, is back (long story, literally) and Jotaro's mom is dying because of him. The solution: road trip from Japan to Egypt with a crew of Stand users to punch DIO really hard.

Stardust Crusaders introduces the Stand system that defines JoJo from this point forward, and it's one of the most brilliant power systems in anime. Stands aren't ranked by pure strength. They're wildly creative abilities with specific rules, and battles become strategic puzzles. How do you beat a Stand that reverses time? One that turns you into a child? One that's literally just a boat?

The honest truth about Part 3: the first half is repetitive. Each episode follows a formula of "arrive in new location, encounter enemy Stand user, figure out their ability, defeat them." Some of these fights are fantastic (Hanged Man, the D'Arby brothers). Some are forgettable filler. The Egypt arc in the second half is where it becomes legendary. The DIO fight at the end is arguably the single most iconic confrontation in anime history.

If you're struggling with Part 3's middle stretch, know that it's worth reaching the end. The payoff is enormous.

### Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable (39 episodes, 2016)

Set in 1999 in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh. Josuke Higashikata (Jotaro's uncle, despite being younger) discovers that the quiet town he lives in is full of Stand users, including a serial killer who's been operating undetected for years.

Part 4 is a tonal left turn. Instead of a globe-trotting adventure, it's a small-town mystery with slice-of-life comedy between the tension. The stakes feel smaller but somehow more personal. You're not saving the world. You're saving a neighborhood. And the villain, Yoshikage Kira, is one of the most unsettling characters in all of anime. He just wants to live a quiet life. He also has a thing about hands.

Many fans rank Diamond is Unbreakable as their favorite part. The ensemble cast is the best in the franchise, the Stand battles get incredibly creative, and Morioh itself becomes a character you care about. It's also where Araki's art style shifts from the hyper-muscular designs of Parts 1-3 to the more fashion-forward, leaner look that defines later JoJo.

### Part 5: Golden Wind (39 episodes, 2018-2019)

Set in 2001 Italy. Giorno Giovanna (who is, improbably, both a Joestar and DIO's son) joins the Italian mafia with the goal of taking it over from the inside. His crew of gangsters with Stands embarks on a mission that's basically a Mafia thriller filtered through Araki's increasingly unhinged creativity.

Golden Wind is pure style. The fashion. The poses. The Stands named after rock bands with abilities that make less and less logical sense but somehow always generate thrilling battles. King Crimson's time-skip ability still starts arguments. Sticky Fingers (renamed Zipper Man in the dub for copyright reasons) is a man who turns things into zippers. It works. Somehow.

The character dynamics in Part 5 are the tightest in the series. Giorno's crew feels like a family, and when the stakes escalate, you feel it. This is also where David Production's animation budget really shows. Some of the fight sequences are genuinely stunning.

### Part 6: Stone Ocean (38 episodes, 2021-2022, Netflix)

Set in 2011 Florida. Jolyne Cujoh (Jotaro's daughter) is framed for a crime and sent to prison. Inside, she discovers she has a Stand and that her imprisonment is part of a much larger scheme connected to DIO's legacy.

Stone Ocean is polarizing for a reason. The prison setting limits some of the adventure freedom of earlier parts, and the pacing, especially in the Netflix batch structure, can feel uneven. Some Stand fights are among the franchise's most creative (Bohemian Rhapsody is insane in the best way). Others drag.

But here's what matters: Stone Ocean's ending is one of the most ambitious, emotionally devastating conclusions in anime. It brings the original JoJo continuity to a close in a way that's been debated by fans for over twenty years. And it directly sets up why Steel Ball Run takes place in an alternate universe. If you're watching JoJo to prepare for SBR, Stone Ocean's finale isn't optional. It's the bridge.

## Steel Ball Run: Why March 2026 Is a Big Deal

Steel Ball Run (Part 7) has been the most anticipated anime adaptation in the JoJo community for years. In manga form, it's consistently ranked as the best JoJo part, and it regularly appears on lists of the greatest manga ever written.

The setup: 1890 America. A cross-country horse race called the Steel Ball Run. Johnny Joestar, a paraplegic ex-jockey, teams up with Gyro Zeppeli, an Italian executioner who uses mysterious steel balls. The race is a cover for something much bigger, and the story evolves into one of the most emotionally rich narratives Araki has ever told.

Why does this need context from Parts 1-6? Because Steel Ball Run is an alternate universe that mirrors the original JoJo continuity. Characters share names, visual designs, and thematic roles with their original counterparts, but in completely different circumstances. Johnny is an alternate Jonathan. Gyro is an alternate Zeppeli. The villain is an alternate version of... well, I won't spoil that. The point is: every parallel hits harder if you know what it's paralleling.

David Production is animating it (they've handled every JoJo anime since 2012). It's a Netflix exclusive, premiering March 19, 2026, as "Stage 1" (suggesting multiple cours or parts). The trailer has already convinced manga skeptics that the adaptation is going to be something special.

You have one month. Pick a route. Start watching.

## The "Should I Skip Parts?" Debate (An Honest Take)

Every JoJo discussion online eventually hits this question, and the community response is always the same: "Don't skip parts." Followed by approximately 200 comments explaining in varying degrees of hostility why skipping parts is a crime against anime.

They're mostly right, but the reasoning matters more than the rule.

People want to skip Part 1 because it's slower and doesn't have Stands. But it's nine episodes. The time you'd spend reading online debates about whether to skip it is probably longer than just watching it. Jonathan and Dio's relationship sets up the emotional core of the entire franchise. Speedwagon alone is worth the investment. Just watch it.

People want to skip to Part 3 because it's the famous one with DIO. You can, technically. But Part 2 is genuinely one of the most entertaining things in the franchise, and skipping it means missing Joseph Joestar, who shows up again in Parts 3 and 4. His character development only works if you met him as a cocky 18-year-old first.

People want to skip to Part 5 because the opening is a meme. Parts 3 and 4 provide the Stand-battle literacy that makes Part 5's fights comprehensible. Without understanding how Stands work from watching them evolve across two parts, Golden Wind's creative abilities feel random instead of innovative.

The only "skip" I'd consider defensible is the Steel Ball Run Sprint route above, and only because SBR is genuinely an alternate universe. Even then, you're losing context that enriches the experience. Think of it this way: you CAN eat dessert first. Nobody's stopping you. But the meal is designed in a specific order for a reason.

## Where to Watch Every JoJo Part in 2026

- **Parts 1-5:** Crunchyroll (sub and dub), Netflix (most regions)
- **Part 6 (Stone Ocean):** Netflix
- **Part 7 (Steel Ball Run):** Netflix exclusive, March 19, 2026
- **Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan (OVA):** Netflix. A spin-off featuring Rohan Kishibe from Part 4. Four standalone supernatural mystery episodes. Watch AFTER Diamond is Unbreakable. Optional but fun.

**Sub vs. Dub:** Both are genuinely good. The Japanese cast is iconic (Takehito Koyasu as DIO, Daisuke Ono as Jotaro). The English dub has its own charm, especially Joseph Joestar in Parts 2-3. One notable difference: the dub changes many Stand names to avoid music copyright issues (so "Killer Queen" becomes "Deadly Queen," "Sticky Fingers" becomes "Zipper Man," etc.). The subtitles keep the original names. Pick whichever you prefer and don't let anyone make you feel bad about it.

## Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan and Other Spin-Offs

After you finish Part 4, you might want more Morioh. Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan is a collection of four OVA episodes on Netflix featuring the manga artist Rohan from Diamond is Unbreakable. They're standalone supernatural mystery stories that showcase Araki's love of horror and the occult.

Netflix also produced a live-action adaptation of these OVAs, which is... surprisingly not terrible. It's Japanese live-action, so expectations are calibrated differently, but it captures the eerie atmosphere reasonably well.

These are entirely optional. They don't connect to the main plot. But they're a nice palette cleanser between parts if you need a breather during your binge.

## FAQ

### How many episodes of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure are there?

190 episodes across six animated parts. Steel Ball Run (Part 7) premieres on Netflix March 19, 2026, and will add to that total. The entire current anime takes about 80 hours to watch at standard speed.

### Can I watch Steel Ball Run without watching the other parts?

Technically, yes. Steel Ball Run takes place in an alternate universe with a standalone story. You won't be lost on the plot. But you'll miss the alternate-universe parallels that are a huge part of what makes SBR special. At minimum, watch Parts 1, 2, and 6 (Stone Ocean) for the thematic foundation.

### Should I skip Part 1 of JoJo?

No. It's nine episodes. Less than four hours. It establishes the Jonathan-Dio rivalry that echoes through six parts and eventually into Steel Ball Run's alternate universe. The time spent debating whether to skip it is longer than just watching it.

### What's the best JoJo part?

This starts fights. The manga community generally ranks Steel Ball Run (Part 7) and Diamond is Unbreakable (Part 4) at the top. Part 2 (Battle Tendency) is often cited as the most purely entertaining. Part 5 (Golden Wind) has the best animation. Honestly, the answer changes based on what you value: story, characters, action, creativity, or emotional weight. Most fans' favorite is whatever part they were watching when JoJo clicked for them.

### Is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure on Crunchyroll?

Parts 1 through 5, yes, with both sub and dub options. Part 6 (Stone Ocean) is a Netflix exclusive. Steel Ball Run (Part 7) will also be Netflix exclusive.

### How long would it take to watch all of JoJo before Steel Ball Run?

At 3 episodes per day: about 63 days (you'd need to have started in December). At 5 episodes per day: about 38 days. At 8 episodes per day: about 24 days. If you're starting today (mid-February 2026), you'd need roughly 6 episodes per day to finish all 190 before March 19. Tight but doable for a dedicated binge. The Steel Ball Run Sprint route (74 episodes) is much more manageable at 3 per day.

### What does "bizarre adventure" actually mean? Is JoJo really that weird?

Yes. A character's power is turning people into snails. Another one can make anything he punches softer. There's a fight resolved by a janken (rock-paper-scissors) tournament. A baby tries to murder people with dream powers. The villain of Part 4 just wants to live a quiet suburban life and collect women's hands. "Bizarre" is not marketing. It's a content warning.
